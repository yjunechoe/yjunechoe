I am a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, studying psycholinguistics and language acquisition.

I'm also an R enthusiast and data visualization hobbyist. Outside of linguistics research, I develop open source software for statistical computing and graphics, data quality assurance, and interfaces to data APIs.
