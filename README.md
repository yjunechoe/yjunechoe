I am a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, studying psycholinguistics (~ experimental pragmatics) and language acquisition (~ word learning).

I'm also an R enthusiast and data visualization hobbyist. Outside of linguistics research, I develop open source software for statistical computing and graphics, data quality assurance, and (interfaces to) data APIs.
